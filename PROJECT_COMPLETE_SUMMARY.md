- **Check on slow internet** - Use Chrome DevTools Network throttling

### Image Optimization
- **Do it before deployment** - Much easier than after
- **Backup originals first** - Always keep high-res versions
- **Check quality after** - Make sure compression didn't hurt quality

### Deployment
- **Start with staging** - Test on free hosting first
- **Use version control** - Git makes updates easier
- **Monitor after launch** - Check for issues in first 24 hours

### Performance
- **Images are #1 issue** - Compressing images gives biggest improvement
